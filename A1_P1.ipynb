    "\n",
    "How they can be used for DNN optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network. This gradient is then used by gradient descent to update the weights in the direction of the negative gradient, which reduces the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple neural network with two inputs, one hidden layer, and one output. The loss function for this network could be the mean squared error between the predicted output and the ground truth output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network, we would start at the output layer and work our way backwards. At each layer, we would calculate the error at that layer and then propagate it back to the previous layer. This process would continue until we reached the input layer.\n",
    "\n",

Backpropagation is used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network, while gradient descent is used to update the weights in the direction of the negative gradient.

    "<p>After computing the loss and doing a backward pass, and given that all weights were initialized with the value 2, we can see that none of the weights changed. Tracing back the steps made, we can see that all partial derivatives with respect to all the weights have a value of 0, which corroborates the fact that none of the weight's values changed. These partial derivatives measure the weight's variation in order for the loss of the neural network to decrease. So, the question now becomes, why all partial derivatives with respect to all weights show that no variation in their values is required in order to decrease the loss? Well, that's because the loss is already at its minimum, which is zero. Looking at how the binary loss is computed, we see that both the expected value and predicted value are exactly the same value, one, meaning that our network predicted perfectly the target. So, this means that there's no more room for improvement, and that's why all partial derivatives with respect to the weights are zero, and as consequence, the weight matrices didn't change.</p>"

Additionally, the Cross-Entropy on the test set is lower for the complex network (0.3200) compared to the original network (0.4217). Lower Cross-Entropy values indicate better model performance.\n",

It achieves both lower training loss and better generalization to the test set, resulting in higher accuracy and lower Cross-Entropy."
